# MXNet Inspector
> A Python tool for checking MXNet installations & inspecting MXNet functionalities on available CPU/GPU devices via basic mathematical operations. Such operations are implemented on matrices, that are represented with MXNet multi-dimensional, fixed-size homogenous arrays. Then, tensor operations on such matrices are run across a set of available CPU/GPU devices.

## Instructions
Run the *inspector.py* script with the following command.
```
python inspector.py
```

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* MXNet 1.2+ (any CPU or GPU installations)
